## Course Topics Overview

This course covers a wide range of operating systems concepts, including:

* **Fundamentals**: OS abstractions, services, processes, and state.
* **Scheduling**: CPU scheduling policies (e.g., Round-Robin), mechanisms, and trade-offs.
* **Memory Management**: Memory allocation, fragmentation, segmentation, swapping, paging, and virtual memory.
* **Concurrency**: Threads, Inter-Process Communication (IPC), synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores, condition variables), mutual exclusion, and deadlock.
* **I/O & Peripherals**: Device drivers and peripheral management.
* **File Systems**: File system implementation (e.g., ext2), allocation, performance, naming, and reliability (FSCK, journaling).
* **Advanced Topics**: Virtual machines, OS security, distributed systems, and consensus.
